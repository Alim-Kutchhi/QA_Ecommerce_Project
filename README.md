# QA E-Commerce Testing Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates manual QA testing skills by testing core functionality of a sample e-commerce web application. 
The goal is to validate that essential features such as login, cart, and checkout work as expected. 
Testing was performed on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/), a public demo site widely used for QA training.

## Deliverables
- **TestCases/QA_TestCases_Template.xlsx**  
  Contains detailed test cases with pre-conditions, execution steps, expected results, and actual outcomes.

- **BugReports/QA_BugReport_Template.xlsx**  
  Log of defects discovered during test execution, with reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, and severity ratings.

## Features Tested
- Login functionality (valid and invalid credentials)
- Adding and removing items from the cart
- Checkout process with valid user information
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## How to Use
1. Open the `TestCases/QA_TestCases_Template.xlsx` file.  
2. Follow the test steps on [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/).  
3. Record actual results and mark status as Pass/Fail.  
4. Log any issues in `BugReports/QA_BugReport_Template.xlsx`.  
5. (Optional) Capture screenshots of issues and save them in `Screenshots/`.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Test case design and execution
- Defect reporting and documentation
- Attention to detail in validating functionality
- Preparing deliverables for a QA portfolio
